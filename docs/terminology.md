### Address
 A unique identifier representing an account or entity within a blockchain network.
### API
 Application Programming Interface, a set of protocols and tools for building software applications.
### Block
A collection of data containing a set of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain.
### Codegen
The process of automatically generating code based on a given input, often used in blockchain development for generating client libraries or interfaces.
### Endpoint
 A URL that can be used to query a Envio custom API. Follows the format of: `https://api.hasura.envio.com/query/<ID>/<INDEXER_NAME>/<VERSION>`
### Entity
 An object or data structure that represents a specific concept or entity within a blockchain system.
### Envio API
The data presentation part of Envio indexer. Typically, it's a GraphQL API auto-generated from the schema file.
### Envio CLI
A command line interface tool for building and deploying to Envio indexers.
### EVM
Ethereum Virtual Machine, a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
### Event
A specific occurrence or action within a blockchain system, often used to trigger actions or notify interested parties.
### Event Handler
A function that listens for a specific event from a smart contract and either updates or inserts new data into your Envio API.
### GraphQL
 A query language for interacting with APIs, commonly used in blockchain systems for retrieving specific data from the blockchain.
### Hosted Service: 
A managed service database platform for building, hosting and querying Envio's Indexers with guarantee uptime and performance service level agreements. 
### Indexer 
a specialized database management system that indexes and organises blockchain data, making it easier for developers to efficiently query, retrieve, and utilise on-chain dat
### JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It is the de facto language for web development and has been around for a long time. It is the language of the web, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
### Multi-chain
Refers to a blockchain system that operates across multiple interconnected chains, enabling enhanced scalability, interoperability, or specific functionalities.
### Node
A device or computer that participates in a blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.
### Ploffen
Ploffen, means Pop in Dutch.
### Query
 A request for data. In the case of Envio, a query is a request for data from a Envio API that will be answered by an Envio Indexer.
### ReScript
ReScript is a syntax extension and produces highly optimized JavaScript code. ReScript aims to bring the power and expressiveness of functional programming to JavaScript development. It offers a seamless integration with JavaScript and provides features like static typing, pattern matching, and immutable data structures.
### Schema File
A file that defines the structure and data types used in a blockchain system, often used to validate and interpret data.
### SDK
Software Development Kit‚Äù is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that facilitates the development of applications for a specific platform or system.
### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, automatically enforcing the agreed-upon rules and conditions. 
### Substrate
A modular blockchain framework developed by Parity Technologies, allowing the creation of customized blockchain networks with specific features.
### Tokens
A digital representation of an asset or utility within a blockchain system, often used for value exchange or access to services.
### Transaction
An action or set of actions recorded on the blockchain, typically involving the transfer of assets, execution of smart contracts, or other network interactions.
### TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript codebases. TypeScript helps developers catch errors during development by providing type checking and improved tooling support. It enhances JavaScript by adding features like interfaces, classes, modules, and generics.
### WASM 
WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that enables the execution of high-performance code on web browsers or blockchain platforms, providing increased security and efficiency.
