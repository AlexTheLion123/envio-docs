### Address
A unique identifier representing an account or entity within a blockchain network.
### API
Application Programming Interface, a set of protocols and tools for building software applications.
### Block
A collection of data containing a set of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain.
### Codegen
The process of automatically generating code based on a given input, often used in blockchain development for generating client libraries or interfaces.
### Endpoint
A URL that can be used to query an Envio custom API.
### Envio CLI
A command line interface tool for building and deploying to Envio indexers.
### EVM
Ethereum Virtual Machine, a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
### Event
A specific occurrence or action within a blockchain system, often used to trigger actions.
### Event Handler
A function that listens for a specific event from a smart contract and either updates or inserts new data into your Envio API.
### GraphQL
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 A query language for interacting with APIs.
=======
A query language for interacting with APIs, commonly used in blockchain systems for retrieving specific data from the blockchain.
### GraphQL API
The data presentation part of Envio indexer. Typically, it's a GraphQL API auto-generated from the schema file.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
### Hosted Service: 
A managed service platform for building, hosting and querying Envio's Indexers with guaranteed uptime and performance service level agreements. 
### Indexer 
a specialized database management system that indexes and organises blockchain data, making it easier for developers to efficiently query, retrieve, and utilise on-chain data.
### JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It is the de facto language for web development and has been around for a long time. It is the language of the web, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
### Node
A device or computer that participates in a blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.
### Ploffen
Ploffen, means Pop in Dutch.
### Query
A request for data. In the case of Envio, a query is a request for data from a Envio API that will be answered by an Envio Indexer.
### ReScript
ReScript is robustly typed language that compiles to efficient and human-readable JavaScript. ReScript aims to bring the power and expressiveness of functional programming to JavaScript development. It offers a seamless integration with JavaScript and provides features like static typing, pattern matching, and immutable data structures.
### Schema File
A file used to define entities based on events emitted from the smart contract and the data types for these entities.
### SDK
Software Development Kit‚Äù is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that facilitates the development of applications for a specific platform or system.
### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, automatically enforcing the agreed-upon rules and conditions. 
### Tokens
A digital representation of an asset or utility within a blockchain system that follows a specific standard, e.g. ERC-20 token, a standard for fungible tokens for creating and issuing smart contracts on the EVM compatible blockchains.
### Transaction
An action or set of actions recorded on the blockchain, typically involving the transfer of assets, execution of smart contracts, or other network interactions.
### TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript codebases. TypeScript helps developers catch errors during development by providing type checking and improved tooling support. It enhances JavaScript by adding features like interfaces, classes, modules, and generics.
### WASM 
WebAssembly, a binary instruction format that enables the execution of high-performance code on web browsers or blockchain platforms, providing increased security and efficiency.
