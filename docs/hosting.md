<sub><sup> NOTE: The architecture of the hosted solution is currently under development. 👷‍♀️👷 </sup></sub>

## Overview

Once event data from the respective blockchains is indexed into entities, this entity information will be stored on a PostgreSQL database.

The design of the hosted solution intentionally prioritizes the reliability and accessibility of data.

Users of Envio can execute GraphQL queries against the hosted database to retrieve information for use in their own platforms.

Envio's hosted solution is also integrated with GitHub. This integration leverages GitHub's security features to ensure that only authorized changes are deployed.
