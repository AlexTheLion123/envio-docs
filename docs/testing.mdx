## Introduction

Envio has a few helpers to assist developers write tests for their code. This library is specifically crafted to allow developers to mock database state and mock events and assert handler logic.  
 
The testing library is simply a series of helper functions that can help writing tests, this means that any JavaScript based testing framework can be used, in the examples we use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

## Learn by doing

Tests are written in all programming languages of the Greeter template and can be explored by following the following steps

Create folder and generate greeter template in typescript
```bash
mkdir greeter && envio init template -l typescript -t greeter
```

Run tests
```bash
pnpm test
```

See the `test/test.ts` file to understand how the tests are written.

## Getting Started

This doc assumes you have a functioning indexer setup with which you intend to write tests for.

Install preferred testing framework, for example mocha

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

```bash
pnpm i mocha
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```bash
pnpm i mocha @types/mocha
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rescript" label="Rescript">

```bash
pnpm i mocha rescript-mocha
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Validate you're using Envio v0.0.26 or above
```bash
envio -V
```

Create a test folder and a test file test.js


Add a test command to your package.json
```json
"test": "mocha",
```
