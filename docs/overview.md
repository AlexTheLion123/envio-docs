Envio is a real-time indexer built specifically for EVM-compatible blockchains, providing developers with a seamless and efficient indexing solution. Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation and flexible language support.
Indexers on Envio can be written in JavaScript, TypeScript or ReScript.

Indexing blockchain data becomes effortless with Envio, offering fast syncing speed and simplified setup steps. Detailed logging and error messaging are provided for effective troubleshooting and debugging.

<!-- One of the standout features of Envio is its ability to aggregate and index data from multiple chains into a hosted database, ensuring reliable uptime and providing monitoring capabilities for the indexer's health status.
-->
To get started with Envio, developers can utilize the Envio CLI, allowing for easy configuration and execution of the indexer. The indexed data is easily accessible through GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information.

The rest of the documentation guides users through the simple steps of configuring and running an Envio indexer.

## Disclaimer

The project is not ready for production use.

Envio is fully capable of indexing, however, there are still some missing features, and we are still working on performance and stability. Because of this, we are still introducing breaking changes.

It has not been audited for security purposes and should not be used in production yet.

We will be updating the documentation with the completion status of each component, as well as include more contributing guidelines (design docs, architecture diagrams, repository layouts) and "good first issues".

We appreciate your patience until we get there. Until then, we are happy to answer all questions in our Discord.
