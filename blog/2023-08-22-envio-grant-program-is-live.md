# **Envio launches ‚ÄúBuild Bigger. Ship Faster‚Äù Grant Program.**

To commemorate the launch of our alpha release, we‚Äôre extending an invitation to all blockchain developers to apply to the **Envio "Build Bigger. Ship Faster" Grant Program**. The premise is simple yet incredibly rewarding: integrate a useful or interesting use case with Envio, share your invaluable feedback on the experience, and receive up to **$1000 USDC.**

As any seasoned developer knows, dealing with the copious amounts of disorganized, slow-to-retrieve data that blockchains generate can be a daunting task. This is where Envio comes in. With its developer-friendly indexing solution, Envio makes receiving, transforming, storing, and accessing on-chain data a breeze. The challenge is to demonstrate how you can build something brilliant using Envio‚Äôs customizable, developer-friendly indexing solution.

## Wondering what to build? üëÄ

Here are a few example ideas you can ship using Envio:

- A simple decentralized application (DApp) powered by Envio
- A useful dashboard (e.g. multi-chain staking dashboard, aggregating protocol fees, etc.)
- An Indexer template for popular OpenZeppelin Standards other than ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 (e.g. Governance contracts)
- Upgrade or migrate an existing use case subgraph (e.g. GMX v2 subgraph, Uniswap V3)
- A template with data handling logic for easily aggregating/calculating SUM/ AVG / MIN / MAX values

## How do I get involved?

- Apply for the Envio ‚ÄúBuild Bigger. Ship Faster" program by submitting a project proposal in Github or via the [form](https://forms.gle/8rMndoELXQY4QYBu9). Recommended steps:
    - Fork the [envio-grant-program repository](https://github.com/Float-Capital/envio-grant-program/tree/main)

## Why Envio?

Envio is a dev-friendly, 3-command init-develop-deploy EVM blockchain data indexing solution that lets you reliably read and process any real-time and historic smart contract events served via rich GraphQL API.

Envio supports indexing any EVM blockchain and allows you to:

- **Write in Javascript, Typescript, and Rescript:** Configure your event handling in a familiar developer friendly, and widely supported language
- **Transform blockchain data with SQL:** Execute low-latency queries or larger analytics jobs to transform and load data into a schema for your specific project.
- **Publish queries to APIs:** Publish datasets and queries directly to APIs, build dApps on top of Envio, and scale easily.
- **Join on-chain and off-chain data:** Connect indexed blockchain data as well as ingest off-chain data to create flexible API for rich data beyond just what is emitted simply from events on-chain. e.g. modules that efficiently index off-chain NFT metadata

Envio is a purpose-built, modern EVM blockchain indexing solution. Envio supports indexing any on-chain event for any EVM blockchain, such as Polygon, Avalanche, Linea Build, Arbitrum, Base, ZkSync, etc.
